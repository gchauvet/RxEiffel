# RxEiffel: Reactive Cluster for Eiffel language

RxEiffel is a Eiffel implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

- Non-opinionated about source of concurrency (threads, pools, event loops, fibers, actors, etc)
- Async or synchronous execution
- Virtual time and schedulers for parameterized concurrency
